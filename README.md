TrustNet is an SOS app built in Flutter using Firebase as its backend. 

### GENERAL GUIDELINES 
1. For every new feature you're working on, create a new branch with the syntax "feature-xxx" and push changes to that. 
2. Once done, make a pull request to merge feature and the dev branch so that we can test stuff out safely without destroying what works already. 
3. Once tested, make a pull request to merge dev and the main branch, this way we minimize the chances of something going fatally wrong.
4. Use the issues tab to raise new issues and/or suggest other stuff like features, and also assign jobs to people
5. Use the github projects tab to keep track of progess on tasks
